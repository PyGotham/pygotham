PyGotham is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for
everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form.
Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled
from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference
organizers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender
identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance,
body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate
intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording,
sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact,
and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing
behavior are expected to comply immediately.

Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities
are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors
should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff
(including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or
otherwise create a sexualized environment.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the conference organizers may
take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or
expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice
that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact
a member of conference staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by
t-shirts/special badges.

PyGotham has an additional rule of no videotaping or photography without prior
permission. If you wish to photograph, film or record any attendee, including
speakers, you must first ask for their permission to do so.

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue
security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those
experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We
value your attendance.
